# Adventure-Sales-Dashboard
This project involves the creation of a dynamic Power BI dashboard using a sales dataset from Adventure Works. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into various business metrics, leveraging the power of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions for advanced calculations and analytics.


Key Features:

    Data Cleaning & Transformation: Data was preprocessed and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy, using Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor.
    
    DAX Calculations: Utilized complex DAX functions for creating custom metrics and KPIs, including Year-over-Year growth, Moving Averages, and Profitability Analysis.
    
    Interactive Visualizations: Built multiple interactive charts and graphs to enable users to explore trends and performance in sales, profit margins, product categories, and more.
    
    Dynamic Slicers: Integrated slicers for dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities to allow users to segment data by time, region, or product category.
    
    User-friendly Dashboard: Developed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard that provides easy-to-understand insights for business decision-makers.
    
    This project showcases my ability to create interactive and insightful business dashboards using Power BI and apply advanced DAX functions for data analysis.
